Local geek association PROGMATICA (http://progmatica.com) requires its pledges
to meet three basic requirements:

	1.) You must live in Maine.
	2.) You must work with computer technology.
	3.) You must write your own Turing Test, as well as another program which can
	    pass it, in the programming language of your choice.

(Presumably all of the above are flexible, as they are a very understanding group.
Just don't cross them.)

Anyway, what you see here is my foolproof Turing Test submission, as well as the
client program which will clearly demonstrate that it is of human origin. To run
it, you need a Python 2.x interpretter, and the folowing modules:

	* PyCATCHA module (svn from http://svn.navi.cx/misc/trunk/pycaptcha/)
	* PIL module (install from http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)

Remember: Be excellent to each other. And... party on, dudes.
